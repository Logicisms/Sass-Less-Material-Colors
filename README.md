# Sass/Less Material Color Palettes

> This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration
> or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.
> The color palette starts with primary colors and fills in the spectrum to create a complete
> and usable palette for Android, Web, and iOS. Google suggests using the 500 colors as the
> primary colors in your app and the other colors as accents colors.

Google's Material Design color palettes, for [Sass/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/).


## Sass

For Sass/SCSS projects, include `_google-material-colors.scss` high in your project's cascade (the Settings or Tools level if you follow [ITCSS](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528) for project management).
The palettes are stored in a nested map, and are accessible through the custom `material-color` function.

To get the desired color, pass the name and (optionally) the tone into the function.
Colors have the same names given on the Material Design website, with hyphenation instead of spaces where relevant.
The tone argument is optional, and will default to 500 if not specified.

Example:
```scss
.block {
    background-color: material-color(deep-purple);
    color: material-color(grey, 100);
}
```
Output:
```css
.block { background-color: #673ab7; color: #f5f5f5; }
```

## Less

For Less projects, including `google-material-colors.less` in your project will add the palette variables to the global scope.
Variables follow a `@material-[color]-[tone]` namespace, with the option to drop `[tone]` and default to 500.

Example:
```less
.block {
    background-color: @material-deep-purple;
    color: @material-grey-100;
}
```
Output:
```css
.block { background-color: #673ab7; color: #f5f5f5 }
```
